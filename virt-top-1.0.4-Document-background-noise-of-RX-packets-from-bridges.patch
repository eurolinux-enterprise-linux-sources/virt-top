+=head2 NETWORK RX BYTES AND PACKETS
+
+Libvirt/virt-top has no way to know that a packet transmitted to a
+guest was received (eg. if the guest is not listening).  In the
+network RX stats, virt-top reports the packets transmitted to the
+guest, on the basis that the guest might receive them.
+
+In particular this includes broadcast packets.  Because of the way
+that Linux bridges work, if the guest is connected to a bridge, it
+will probably see a steady "background noise" of RX packets even when
+the network interface is idle or down.  These are caused by STP
+packets generated by the bridge.
